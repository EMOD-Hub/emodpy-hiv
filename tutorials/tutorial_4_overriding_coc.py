=== Tutorial #4 - Overriding a State in the Cascade of Care ===
Sometimes the default cascade of care doesn't do exactly what you need.
For instance, you might need to add a decision point to determine if someone 
gets Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) or whether they wait. Maybe you want to 
break ART into effective ART and non-suppressive ART. This tutorial provides 
you an example on how to customize the cascade of care to meet your needs.

--- To override state, subclass country model ---
We use the concept of a "country model" to combine the collection of data 
and code needed to model a particular country. As you may have noticed from
the previous tutorials, the country model has its own build functions that 
we use for creating our `EMODTask`. The base class `Country` has a default 
`build_campaign()` method that defines a default set of methods to call for 
constructing the cascade of care. You can override this method or any of the 
methods that are part of the construction algorithm.

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===
There are two/three places below that you need to change depending on your platform
(COMPS or SLURM).  Look for the lines with UPDATE.


--- SLURM platform parameters ---
SLURM_LOCAL      - This tells idmtools you are on a ... local slurm cluster
job_directory    - directory containing suite/experiment/simulation directories
time             - maximum allowed runtime of a simulation (HH:MM:SS)
partition        - the set of nodes to submit the simulation jobs to
mail_user        - you can get emailed updates when your experiments finish here
mail_type        - ... if you set this parameter (ALL means jobs begin, finish, ...
max_running_jobs - This and the next param are for idmtools to allow parallel simulations
array_batch_size - ???

        The baseline `HCTUptakeAtDebut` state listens for the `STIDebut` built-in 
        event. This event is broadcast when the person decides to start seeking 
        sexual relationships. When this state hears this event, it will use a sigmoid 
        distribution to determine the probability that the person will enter the 
        testing loop or wait and consider it again later.

        In this example, we override this method by making the baseline implementation 
        only last the first 35 years (i.e., 1990 to 2025). In 2025, when it expires, 
        we start a new listener for `STIDebut` that will distribute a very long-lasting 
        PrEP and then send the person through the same sigmoid logic.

        __NOTE:__ In the last `add_triggered_event`, notice that it is distributing the 
        same `uptake_choice` intervention as the first one. This is one of those 
        benefits of using Python. If this were done in JSON, the configuration of 
        `uptake_choise` would have to be copy and pasted. Not having this data duplcated
        multiple times should lead to fewer bugs.
