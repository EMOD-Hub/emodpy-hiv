CONSTANT_DISTRIBUTION

UNIFORM_DISTRIBUTION
    Use a `uniform`_ distribution with a given minimum and maximum. Set **Delay_Period_Max** and **Delay_Period_Min**.
GAUSSIAN_DISTRIBUTION
    The distribution is `Gaussian`_ (or normal). Values are resampled to ensure >= 0. Set **Delay_Period_Gaussian_Mean** and **Delay_Period_Gaussian_Std_Dev**.
