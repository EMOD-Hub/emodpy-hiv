The simulation uses an N x N square grid of nodes with N specified by this parameter. If migration is enabled, the N x N nodes are assumed to be a torus and individuals can migrate from any node to all four adjacent nodes. 

To enable migration, set **Migration_Model** to FIXED_RATE_MIGRATION. Built-in migration is a form of ""local"" migration where individuals only migrate to the adjacent nodes. You can use the **x_Local_Migration** parameter to control the rate of migration. The other migration parameters are ignored.
