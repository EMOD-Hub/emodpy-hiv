Possible values are:

NOT_INITIALIZED
    No distribution set. 
CONSTANT_DISTRIBUTION
    Use the same value for each individual. Set **Delay_Period_Constant**.
UNIFORM_DISTRIBUTION
    Use a `uniform`_ distribution with a given minimum and maximum. Set **Delay_Period_Max** and **Delay_Period_Min**.
GAUSSIAN_DISTRIBUTION
    The distribution is `Gaussian`_ (or normal). Values are resampled to ensure >= 0. Set **Delay_Period_Gaussian_Mean** and **Delay_Period_Gaussian_Std_Dev**.
EXPONENTIAL_DISTRIBUTION
    The distribution is `exponential`_ with a given mean. Set **Delay_Period_Exponential**.
WEIBULL_DISTRIBUTION
    Use a `Weibull`_ distribution with a given shape and scale. Set **Delay_Period_Kappa** and **Delay_Period_Lambda**.
LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION
    Use a `log-normal`_ distribution with a given mean and standard deviation of the natural log. Set **Delay_Period_Log_Normal_Mu** and **Delay_Period_Log_Normal_Sigma**.
POISSON_DISTRIBUTION
    Use a `Poisson`_ distribution with a given mean. Set **Delay_Period_Poisson_Mean**. 
DUAL_CONSTANT_DISTRIBUTION
    Use a distribution where some individuals are set to a value of zero and the rest to a given value. Set **Delay_Period_Proportion_0** and **Peak_2_Value**. This distribution does not use the parameters set for CONSTANT_DISTRIBUTION.
DUAL_EXPONENTIAL_DISTRIBUTION
    Use two `exponential`_ distributions with given means. Set **Delay_Period_Mean_1**, **Delay_Period_Mean_2**, and **Delay_Period_Proportion_1**. This distribution does not use the parameters set for EXPONENTIAL_DISTRIBUTION.
