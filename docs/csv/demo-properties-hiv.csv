"Age_Bin_Edges_In_Years","array","NA","NA","NA","An array of integers that represents the ages, in years, at which to demarcate the age groups for individuals. Used only with the **Age_Bin** property type. The first number must be 0, the last must be -1, and they must be listed in ascending order. Cannot be used with **NodeProperties**.

|EMOD_s| automatically create the individual property **Age_Bin** with values based on the bin edges using the format **Age_Bin_Property_From_X_To_Y**. These appear in the property reports and can be used to target campaign interventions using **Property_Restrictions_Within_Node**. See :doc:`model-targeted-interventions` for more information.","The following example creates three age groups: 0 to 5, older than 5 to 13, and older than 13 to the maximum age.

Age_Bin
   Assign individuals to age bins. Use with **Age_Bin_Edges_In_Years**. Cannot be used with **NodeProperties**.
Accessibility
   Tag individuals or nodes based on their accessibility. 
Geographic
   Tag individuals or nodes based on geographic characteristics.
HasActiveTB
   Tag individuals or nodes based on active TB status. Typically used only with HIV ART staging interventions.
InterventionStatus
   Tag individuals or nodes based on intervention status, so that receiving an intervention can affect how other interventions are distributed. Use with **Disqualifying_Properties** and **New_Property_Value** in the campaign file. 
Place
   Tag individuals or nodes based on place.

   Tag individuals or nodes based on disease risk.

   Tag individuals or nodes based on the quality of medical care.
