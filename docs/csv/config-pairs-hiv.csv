These unlikely relationships could be generated due to lack of diversity in the PFA. Within the algorithm, males pick from amongst the available females by age bin, weighted by the conditional of the joint_probability matrix given the male age bin. If the sum of the probabilities in the female age bins that are not empty is below this threshold, the male will wait till the next update. Setting this parameter to a value near 1 dramatically increases the delay that individuals will experience in seeking relationships.
