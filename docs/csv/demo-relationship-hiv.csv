Terminate
    Relationship is stopped. The individual's relationship count is decremented so they can enter new relationships.
Pause
    Relationship is put on hold. The couple is not in the same node so they cannot consummate their relationship, but the individual's relationship count is not decremented since they are still in the relationship. The relationship can resume if both partners are in the same node, which need not be their home node. Relationship duration timers continue and relationship could terminate while paused.
Migrate
    Partners in the relationship migrate simultaneously and continue the relationship. Person migrating tells their partner to cancel all of their relationships and migrate during the current time step. This avoids a cascade of people migration.",".. code-block:: json
