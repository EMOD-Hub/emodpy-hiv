InsetChart
==========

The inset chart (InsetChart.json) is an output report that is automatically generated with every simulation.
It contains simulation-wide averages, one per time step, for a wide number of data :term:`channel`\ s.
The channels are fully specified by the simulation type and cannot be altered without making changes
to the |EMOD_s| source code. Python or other tools can be used to create charts out of the information
contained in the file (see the example charts provided at the end of this page.)


Configuration
=============

To generate the report, the following parameters must be configured in the config.json file:

.. csv-table::
   :header: Parameter, Data type, Min, Max, Default, Description
   :widths: 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 20


   Enable_Default_Reporting, boolean, NA, NA, 1, "Set this to 1 (default value) to generate the report."
   Report_HIV_Event_Channels_List, array of strings, NA, NA, [], "The list of events to be included in the report. For each event specified with this parameter, one channel will be added to the report. See :doc:`parameter-campaign-event-list` for possible values. If no events are listed, a 'Number of Events' channel will be included on the report and display the total number of all events that occurred during the simulation."
   Inset_Chart_Include_Coital_Acts, boolean, NA, NA, 0, "When set to 1, the report will include channels about the number of coital acts per relationship type per dayâ€”in total, and those using condoms (eight channels added)."
   Inset_Chart_Has_Interventions, array of strings, NA, NA, [], "A list of interventions to be included in the report. For each intervention listed, one channel is added to the report showing the fraction of the population that has that intervention at that time step. Note: the  values specified here must match the **Intervention_Name** parameters listed in the campaign.json file. See :doc:`parameter-campaign-individual-interventions` for information on configuring these parameters."
   Inset_Chart_Has_IP, array of strings, NA, NA, [], "A list of individual property (IP) keys to be included in the report. For each value of each IP key provided, one channel is added to the report showing the fraction of the population with that Key:Value pair, at that time step (for example, the fractions in Risk:LOW, Risk:MEDIUM, and Risk:HIGH). See :doc:`model-properties` for additional information on configuring IPs."
   Inset_Chart_Include_Pregnancies, boolean, NA, NA, 0, "If set to 1, three channels are included in the report showing counts of new pregnancies, current pregnancies, and possible mothers at each time step."
