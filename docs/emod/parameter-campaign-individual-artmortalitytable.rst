=================

The **ARTMortalityTable** intervention class allows the user to modify an individualâ€™s life expectancy 
based on different levels of ART adherence; the user defines parameters for age, CD4 count, and time on ART 
in a multi-dimensional table which is then used to determine mortality rate. Note: If you have have different adherence levels for each gender, then you will need to configure your campaign to distribute an **ARTMortalityTable** for each gender and adherence level.
