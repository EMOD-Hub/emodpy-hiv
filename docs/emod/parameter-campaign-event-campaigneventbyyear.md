# CampaignEventByYear

The **CampaignEventByYear** event class determines when to distribute the intervention based on the
calendar year. See the following JSON example and table, which shows all available parameters for this
campaign event.

> **NOTE:**
> Parameters are case-sensitive. For Boolean parameters, set to 1 for true or 0 for false.
> Minimum, maximum, or default values of "NA" indicate that those values are not applicable for
> that parameter.
>
> EMOD does not use true defaults; that is, if the dependency relationships indicate that a parameter is required, you must supply a value for it. However, many of the tools used to work with EMOD will use the default values provided below.
>
> JSON format does not permit comments, but you can add "dummy" parameters to add contextual
> information to your files. Any keys that are not EMOD parameter names will be ignored by the
> model.
