ImmunityBloodTest
=================

The **ImmunityBloodTest** intervention class identifies whether an individual's immunity meets a
specified threshold (as set with the **Positive_Threshold_AcquisitionImmunity** campaign parameter)
and then broadcasts an event based on the results; positive has immunity while negative does not.
Note that **Base_Sensitivity** and **Base_Specificity** function whether or not the immunity is
above the threshold.
