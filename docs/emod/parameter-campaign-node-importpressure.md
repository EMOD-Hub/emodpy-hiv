# ImportPressure

The **ImportPressure** intervention class extends the **ImportCases** outbreak event. Rather than importing a
deterministic number of cases on a scheduled day, **ImportPressure** applies a set of per-day rates
of importation of infected individuals, over a corresponding set of durations. **ImportPressure**
inherits from **Outbreak**; the **Antigen** and **Genome** parameters are defined as they are for all
**Outbreak** events.

> **WARNING:**
> Be careful when configuring import pressure in multi-node simulations.
> **Daily_Import_Pressures**  defines a rate of per-day importation for *each* node that the
> intervention is distributed to. In a 10 node simulation with  **Daily_Import_Pressures** = [0.1,
> 5.0], the total importation rate summed over all nodes will be 1/day and 50/day during the two
> time periods. You must divide the per-day importation rates by the number of
> nodes.

> **NOTE:**
> Parameters are case-sensitive. For Boolean parameters, set to 1 for true or 0 for false.
> Minimum, maximum, or default values of "NA" indicate that those values are not applicable for
> that parameter.
>
> EMOD does not use true defaults; that is, if the dependency relationships indicate that a parameter is required, you must supply a value for it. However, many of the tools used to work with EMOD will use the default values provided below.
>
> JSON format does not permit comments, but you can add "dummy" parameters to add contextual
> information to your files. Any keys that are not EMOD parameter names will be ignored by the
> model.

The table below describes all possible parameters with which this class can be configured. The JSON
