CD4Diagnostic
=============

The **CD4Diagnostic** intervention class is similar to :doc:`parameter-campaign-individual-simplediagnostic`,
but adds the ability to divide individual populations based on configurable CD4
count ranges. It uses the individualâ€™s current actual CD4 count, regardless of when a CD4 test has
been performed. An event can then be applied based on the Low or High group to which the individuals
have been moved.
