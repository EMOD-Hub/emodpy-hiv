Before you begin, you must have the following:

* **sudo** privileges to install packages
* 15 GB free in your home directory (if you install the |EMOD_s| source code and input files)
* An Internet connection


#.  On GitHub on the `EMOD releases`_ page, download and run the PrepareLinuxEnvironment.sh script.

    Respond to the prompts for information while the script is running. 

    a.  Set the EMOD_ROOT environment variable to the path to the |EMOD_s| source path::

            EMOD_ROOT=~/IDM/EMOD

    b.  Include Scripts and . in the path::

            export PATH=$PATH:.:$EMOD_ROOT/Scripts

    c.  If you want to run simulations in the same session that you updated EMOD_ROOT and
        the Scripts path, reload the .bashrc file using ``source .bashrc``.
