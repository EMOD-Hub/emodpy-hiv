The **IndividualAttributes** section contains parameters that initialize the distribution of
attributes across individuals, such as the age or immunity. An initial value for an
individual is a randomly selected value from a given distribution. These distributions can be
configured using a simple flag system of three parameters or a complex system of
many more parameters. The following table contains the parameters that can be used with either
distribution system.
