Metadata provides information about data provenance. **IdReference** is the
only parameter used by |EMOD_s|, but you are encouraged to include information for your
own reference. For example, author, date created, tool used, NodeCount and more are commonly included
in the **Metadata** section. You can include any information you like here provided it is
in valid JSON format.  **IDReference** is used to connect the files together; the climate, migration, and demographics files all have **IdReference** so that there is some way to know that they go together (i.e. know about the same nodes).

If you generate :term:`input files` using |COMPS_s|, the following **IdReference** values are
possible and indicate how the **NodeID** values are generated:

Gridded world grump30arcsec
    Nodes are approximately square regions defined by a 30-arc second grid and the **NodeID** values
    are generated from the latitude and longitude of the northwest corner.
Gridded world grump2.5arcmin
    Nodes are approximately square regions defined by a 2.5-arc minute grid and the **NodeID** values
    are generated from the latitude and longitude of the northwest corner.
Gridded world grump1degree
    Nodes are approximately square regions defined by a 1-degree grid and the **NodeID** values are
    generated from the latitude and longitude of the northwest corner.

The algorithm for encoding latitude and longitude into a **NodeID** is as follows::

   unsigned int xpix = math.floor((lon + 180.0) / resolution)
   unsigned int ypix = math.floor((lat + 90.0) / resolution)
   unsigned int NodeID = (xpix << 16) + ypix + 1

This generates a **NodeID** that is a 4-byte unsigned integer; the first two bytes represent the
longitude of the node and the second two bytes represent the latitude. To reserve 0 to be used as a
null value, 1 is added to the **NodeID** as part of the final calculation.
