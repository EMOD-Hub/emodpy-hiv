(Optional) Download input files
===============================

|IDM_s| provides :term:`input files` that describe the demographics, migration patterns, and climate of
many different locations across the world. You can download these files from the EMOD-InputData repository, which uses large file storage (LFS) to manage the binaries and large
:term:`JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)` files. A standard Git clone of the repository will only
retrieve the metadata for these files managed with LFS. To retrieve the actual data, follow the
steps below.


#.  Install the Git LFS plugin, if it is not already installed.

    * For Windows users, download the plugin from https://git-lfs.github.com.
    * For |Centos| users, the plugin is included with the PrepareLinuxEnvironment.sh script.

#.  Using a Git client or Command Prompt window, clone the input data repository to retrieve
    the metadata::

        git clone https://github.com/InstituteforDiseaseModeling/EMOD-InputData.git

#.  Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the metadata for the
    input files.

#.  Download the actual data on your local machine::

        git lfs fetch

#.  Replace the metadata in the files with the actual data::

        git lfs checkout
