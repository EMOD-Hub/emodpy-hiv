Complex distributions are more effort to configure, but are useful for representing real-world data
where the distribution does not fit a standard. Individual attribute values are drawn from a piecewise
linear distribution. The distribution is configured using arrays of axes (such as gender or age) and
values at points along each of these axes. This allows you to have different distributions for
different groups in the population.
