#.  In a web browser, go to |Python_supp_path| to install |Python_supp|.

#.  Scroll down and download one of the **x86-64** bit installers (you may use the executable installer
    or the web-based installer.)

#.  Double-click the executable file and, in the installer window, select the **Add Python 3.9 to PATH**
    checkbox and click **Customize installation**.

#.  On the **Optional Features** window that opens, leave all default values selected and click **Next**. The 
    Python package manager, pip, is used to install other Python packages.

#.  If you are running |EMOD_s| locally, |IDM_s| recommends that you select the **Advanced Options** window
    to customize the installation directory to "C:\\Python39".

    You may install Python in another location, but the Python plotting scripts included in the
    `EMOD scenarios`_ zip file assume that Python is installed directly under the C: drive. If you
    install it elsewhere, you may need to edit those scripts when using the scenarios to learn about
    |EMOD_s| functionality.

#.  Click **Install**. When installation is complete, click **Close**.

#.  To verify installation, open a Command Prompt window and type the following::

        python --version
