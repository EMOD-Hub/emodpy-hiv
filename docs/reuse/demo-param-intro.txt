The parameters described in this reference section can be added to the :term:`JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)` formatted demographics file to determine the demographics of the population within
each geographic :term:`node` in a simulation. For example, the number of individuals and the
distribution for age, gender, immunity, risk, and mortality. These parameters work closely with the
:doc:`parameter-configuration-population` parameters in the :term:`configuration file`, which are simulation-wide and
generally control whether certain events, such as births or deaths, are enabled in a simulation.

Generally, you will download a demographics file and modify it to meet the needs of your
simulation. Demographics files for several locations are available on the |IDM_l|
GitHub `EMOD-InputData <https://github.com/InstituteforDiseaseModeling/EMOD-InputData>`_ repository or
you can use |COMPS_l| to generate demographics and climate files for a particular region.
By convention, these are named using the name of the region appended with "_demographics.json", but
you may name the file anything you like.

Additionally, you can use more than one demographics file, with one serving as the base layer and
the one or more others acting as overlays that override the values in the base layer. This can be
helpful if you want to experiment with different values in the overlay without modifying your base
file. For more information, see :doc:`software-demographics`.

At least one demographics file is required for every simulation unless you set the parameter
**Enable_Demographics_Builtin** to 1 (one) in the :term:`configuration file`. This setting does not
represent a real location and is generally only used for testing and validating code pathways rather
than actual modeling of disease.

Demographics files are organized into four main sections: **Metadata**, **NodeProperties**,
**Defaults**, and **Nodes**. The following example shows the skeletal format of a demographics file.

.. literalinclude:: ../json/demographics-skeletal.json
   :language: json

All parameters except those in the **Metadata** and **NodeProperties** sections below can appear in
either the **Defaults** section or the **Nodes** section of the demographics file. Parameters under
**Defaults** will be applied to all nodes in the simulation. Parameters under **Nodes** will be
applied to specific nodes, overriding the values in **Defaults** if they appear in both. Each node in
the **Nodes** section is identified using a unique **NodeID**.
