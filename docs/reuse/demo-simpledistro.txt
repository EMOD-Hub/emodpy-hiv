Simple distributions are defined by three parameters where one is a flag for the distribution type
and the other two are used to further define the distribution. For example, if you set the age flag
to a uniform distribution, the initial ages of individuals in the simulation will be evenly
distributed between some minimum and maximum value as defined by the other two parameters.
