The following parameters scale or multiply values set in other areas of the configuration file or other
:term:`input files`. This can be especially useful for understanding the sensitivities of
disease dynamics to input data without requiring modifications to those base values. For example,
one might set **x_Birth** to a value less than 1 to simulate a lower future birth rate due to increased
economic prosperity and available medical technology.
