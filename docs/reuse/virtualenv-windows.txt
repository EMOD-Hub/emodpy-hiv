Python virtual environments enable you to isolate your Python environments from one
another and give you the option to run multiple versions of Python on the same computer. When using a
virtual environment, you can indicate the version of Python you want to use and the packages you
want to install, which will remain separate from other Python environments. You may use
``virtualenv``, but ``venv`` is recommended and included with Python 3.3+.


#.  Navigate to the location where you want to create the virtual environment directory and enter the
    following to create a environment called "idm", or other desired name::

        python -m venv idm

#.  To activate the virtual environment, enter the following::

        idm\Scripts\activate

#.  Verify that the command prompt displays "idm" at the beginning, which indicates that you are in
    the idm virtual environment. For example::

        (idm) my-computer:idm

#.  To verify you are using |Python_supp|, enter the following::

        python --version

#.  When you are done working in this virtual environment, deactivate the environment. The
    environment will be saved and you can reactivate it at any time. To deactivate, enter the following::

        deactivate
