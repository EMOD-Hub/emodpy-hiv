We recommended that you download some of the NumPy Python package from
http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs, a page compiled by Christoph Gohlke, University of
California, Irvine. The libraries there include linear algebra packages that are not included by default with the standard Windows packages. They are compiled Windows binaries, including the 64-bit versions
required by |EMOD_s|. The naming convention used lists the Python version after "cp", for example "cp39-cp39m", and the Windows bit version after "win", for example "win_amd64".
