# emodpy-hiv
emodpy-hiv is an extension to emodpy that contains HIV-specific campaign, demographics, and reporting classes for 
configuring EMOD-HIV simulations. Standard country-specific configurations are wrapped into "country model" classes, 
providing easily accessible, modifiable, and consistent starting points for new projects. HIV-specific plotting tools 
are also provided to aid in exploring model output.
