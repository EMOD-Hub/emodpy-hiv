# emodpy-hiv
Python module for use as user-space front-end for doing research easily with EMOD (HIV_SIM) via idmtools


## Description

This package provides a Python scriptable interface for configuring EMOD for HIV modeling. This Python interface abstracts the process of creating JSON formatted files for parameter specification, demographics specification and intervention specification along as well as abstracting the process of creating binary climate and migration files.

## Get `emodpy-hiv`

The `emodpy-hiv` package (and its supporting packages) is currently hosted on IDM's Python package repository.

```shell
python3 -m pip install emodpy-hiv --index-url=https://packages.idmod.org/api/pypi/pypi-production/simple
```

Note: you may need to only use `python` on Windows machines rather than `python3`.
