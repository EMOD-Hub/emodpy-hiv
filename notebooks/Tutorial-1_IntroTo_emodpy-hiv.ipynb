    "# Introduction to emodpy-hiv\n",
    "\n",
    "`emodpy-hiv` is the new way for configuring, running, and analyzing EMOD-HIV simulations. It replaces the previous DtkTools/HIV-Analyzers/run_scenarios.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the goals of this new tool is to simplify the configuration of EMOD by allowing the user to do it via Python instead of JSON. This provides several benefits, including:\n",
    "- Eliminating the need to worry about where parameters belong in deeply nested JSON.\n",
    "- Detecting configuration errors in the Python code before the simulations are created.\n",
    "- Using a 'for-loop' to vary a single value instead of copy and pasting large chunks of JSON.\n",
    "- Leveraging a Python IDE to provide tool-tips or navigate into functions to see the definition of the arguments/parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The packages of emodpy\n",
    "The emodpy “framework” consists of a collection of packages. Each package provides a set of features related to configuring and running EMOD.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **emod-api**\n",
    "   - Defines base-level objects and how the input files of EMOD are written or read.\n",
    "- **emod-hiv** (notice no “py”)\n",
    "   - Contains a schema and Eradication binary.\n",
    "- **emodpy**\n",
    "   - Provides the common set of EMOD configuration features used by disease-specific versions. Users generally do not need to know much about this package.\n",
    "- **emodpy-hiv/malaria**\n",
    "   - These disease-specific packages should be the primary packages users utilize for configuring EMOD for the disease they are working on. These packages are a “subclass” of emodpy.\n",
    "- **idmtools**\n",
    "   - Provides a low-level workflow framework. It offers an abstract way to run EMOD on different platforms and supports a workflow that involves suites, experiments, and simulations. By itself, it is model-agnostic, similar to a model-agnostic DtkTools.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "- `mkdir emodpy_demo`\n",
    "- `cd emodpy_demo`\n",

    "- `pip install --index-url https://packages.idmod.org/api/pypi/pypi-production/simple emodpy-hiv`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Manifest\n",
    "Manifest.py is used to store settings that are either common across scripts for running experiments or vary for different users.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The installed package includes a schema and executable.\n",
    "- Manifest allows you to specify other executables and schema.\n",

Hence, you need a binary before you can do anything. To make this easier, an emodpy-hiv package requirement is that you also get the emod-hiv binary package (notice no \"py\" after the \"emod\").  This package contains an executable and an associated schema file that you can use with this version of emodpy-hiv.\n",

Configuration parameters are very easy to change, but as we will see in a later tutorial, the campaign and demographics require a bit more work. It is not much, but it is different. Notice that the function returns a \"tag\" name and its corresponding value. These tags can be used to sort or query your simulations - based on the tags.\n",
