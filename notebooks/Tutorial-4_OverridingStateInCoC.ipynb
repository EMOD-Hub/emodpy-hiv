    "# Tutorial #4 - Overriding a state in the cascade of care\n",
    "Sometimes the default cascade of care doesn't do exactly what you need. For instance, you might need to add a decision point to determine if someone gets Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) or whether they wait. Maybe you want to break ART into effective ART and non-suppressive ART. This tutorial provides you an example on how to customize the cascade of care to meet your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## To override state, subclass country model\n",
    "We use the concept of a \"country model\" to combine the collection of data and code needed to model a particular country. As you may have noticed from the previous tutorials, the country model has its own build functions that we use for creating our `EMODTask`. The base class `Country` has a default `build_campaign()` method that defines a default set of methods to call for constructing the cascade of care. You can override this method or any of the methods that are part of the construction algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "`<WARNING-ObjectOrientedDesign-Lesson>` This approach is similar to the [Template Method design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern). The main idea is that there is a main algorithm consisting of a collection of methods that implement the algorithm.  One can subclass the class implementing the template and then override any portion of the algorithm that they'd like.`</WARNING-ObjectOrientedDesign-Leason>`\n",
    "\n",
    "__NOTE:__ This is one of those places where using an IDE that supports Python can really come in handy. If you were looking at the `build_campaign` function in the notebook for Tutorial #3 in Visual Studio Code, you could right-click on `cm.Zambia()`, select \"Go to Definition\", and it would take you to the code. Once you are looking at the code for Zambia, you can find the method you want to override, copy the code from the Zambia model, paste into your country model, and start modifying it.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Right Click in Visual Studio](Tutorial-4_RightClickOnZambia.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The baseline `HCTUptakeAtDebut` state listens for the `STIDebut` built-in event. This event is broadcast when the person decides to start seeking sexual relationships. When this state hears this event, it will use a sigmoid distribution to determine the probability that the person will enter the testing loop or wait and consider it again later.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we override this method by making the baseline implementation only last the first 35 years (i.e., 1990 to 2025). In 2025, when it expires, we start a new listener for `STIDebut` that will distribute a very long-lasting PrEP and then send the person through the same sigmoid logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "__NOTE:__ In the last `add_triggered_event`, notice that it is distributing the same `uptake_choice` intervention as the first one. This is one of those benefits of using Python. If this were done in JSON, the configuration of `uptake_choise` would have to be copy and pasted. Not having this data duplcated multiple times should lead to fewer bugs."
