    "# Tutorial #3 - Build functions\n",
    "This tutorial will introduce you to creating your own build functions so that you can modify the baseline country model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are build functions?\n",
    "These are the functions that `EMODTask` calls to build the configuration files for each simulation in the experiement. They are called once for each simulation, so if you were to have a significant amount of processing in a build function, it will get multiplied by the number of simulations in your experiement. While you probably won't have extensive processing, it is something to be aware of.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your build functions can have whatever name you wish, but users typically choose build_config, build_campaign, and build_demographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "`build_config()` - This function will get called first to set the basic, simulation-wide configuration parameters.\n",
    "`build_campaign()` - This function is used for creating the logic of when, who, why, and how interventions are distributed.\n",
    "`build_demograpics()` - The demographics configuration determines the number of initial people in your scenario, fertility rates, mortality rates, and relationship parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## `build_config()`\n",
    "In our example function, we are going to double the initial population of the baseline and reduce the duration of the simulation by 10 years.  The increased population will make the simulations take longer, but the reduction in length should reduce that increase.  (Simulations might take 5-7 minutes.)"
